## About the Project

This project aims to enhance the segmentation and registration of multiparametric renal MR images by leveraging domain-specific contrast information from unlabeled images. 
We utilize contrastive learning to develop a tissue-specific representation from multi-contrast images, capturing distinctive features for improved segmentation. 
The learned representations also enable robust image registration across varying contrasts, creating a comprehensive framework for feature extraction.
